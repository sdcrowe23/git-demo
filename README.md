# GitHub Demo

## Stuff done from GitHub side

This is dummy text // pretend I deleted this line here.

I might add another line of dummy text.. but idk.

This line was created on GitHub and is used to test pulling using the CLI.

## Pushing to GitHub

This line was added from VSC and is being pushed to GitHub.

I will add the line above to GitHub from VSC.

`git status` // tells me if there are files with recent changes.
`git add . && git commit -m "comment"` // tells git to add changes in the working directory to the staging directory, and captures a snapshot of the projects currently staged changes.
`git push` // pushes changes to GitHub repo.
